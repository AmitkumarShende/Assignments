    Okay. So you have been seeing people display their Macbooks and you have always fancied owning one of those premium devices. Now, as Amazon offers this Macbook Air at a reduced price, you are getting tempted to buy this. STOP and consider what you get for the money you spend. Do not buy this if you think this adds some premiumness to your profile. It will not - because this device is next in line where support will be withdrawn by Apple. Resist temptation - because THAT is what Apple sells. The last reason to buy should be your feeling that it improves your profile. Apple users will smirk when they see you with an obsolete 'dinosaur' device as they display their latest toys.If you are a windows user - better go to some friend's Macbook and try some activities. MAC OS is great till you try to change something as puny as your mouse cursor!! You realise that you are stuck in the little cozy jail of Apple once you try anything non-standard. Try transferring data by a USB stick from your other laptop to this one .... you will need training. USB partitioning has to be only ExFAT - and evn if you do this partitioning on a MAC, chances are that Windows will not recognise the USB stick. If you are not a power user - this can be a real pain. Of course, you can pretend (like so many thousands of Apple users) that these do not matter. But hey - they do. A premium DELL or HP may be the best option for you. (Yes, I will first discourage you from buying this and then explain why I purchased this for myself)Know that you are giving up the option of buying RAM or SSD from the neighbouring shop to extend the device life. You wil depend on Apple and on Apple alone. Of course there are generic spares - but these too are more expensive than the DELL or HP spares. Once Apple pulls the plug of support, these spares may get even more expensive. In fact, hardware upgrade beyond increasing the SSD is very much a rare luxury. Thankfully, I have kept myself out of this snob-race that Apple peddles.If you are still reading - here are the good sides (why I purchased this in spite of what I wrote above)A Mac is a Mac is a Mac. So is this one. The hardware are perfectly matched and performance is always optimal. This laptop is for carrying along as a second laptop, alongside my official one, a DELL workhorse. MAcbook Air is lightweight and can run other operating systems. I use this to run Windows and Linux.The MAC OS is a very stable Operating system. Chances are that you will never face a single crash in your lifetime of using this Macbook Air. Windows is fragile (too many bugs and updates) and Linux is difficult (you need a little training). That's where the Macbook Air comes in Handy. With Parallels desktop, you can load Linux and Windows on Virtual Machines on the Mac. You can seamlessly go from one OS to another without rebooting. However, note that with 'parallels desktop' you are operating Windows and Linux from your little cell in the Apple jail. And be prepared to shell out a good amount to \"buy\" this software. It is possible to load linux differently so that it works outside the Apple shell. Quite a saving grace. Using BootCamp (through a dual bootng feature), you can take advantage of the multi-tasking power of Windows without the risk of getting blue screens or hanged functions. So overall that looks great.Now coming back to my rating... I run mostly Windows and Linux on this MAC. Happy with it because the hardware is great. I consider myself a power user - so I know that I can find alternatives for this if and when Apple pulls the plug of support (should be available for at least another year, and a certain period after that as Apple's support to \"obsolete\" devices). Hence a durability rating of 3 stars only !!That (above) is the truth laid bare. Please decide and buy at your own risk.~~ Buy this if you like the hardware (but know that DELL or HP would give a much better hardware at this price, and those will be upgradable and last much longer than this)~~ Buy this because you understand that this hardware is very stable and Mac OS can protect your windows as it works in the MAC Shell. Buy this because you can run Linux once Mac makes this obsolete.~~ Do not buy this if you feel it adds to your premium value. It will be a dinosaur soon and you will be left stranded. Think of the plight of iPhone 5, which was premium 24 months ago. People rushed and purchased their \"cheap iPhone\" around a year back. Today, they have no pride in showing off a device that is obsolete. Tomorrow, Apple will make it sluggish and they will be forced to upgrade.EDIT/ADD [02/12/2019]: If you plan to upgrade your SSD to 500GB, please look at SSD (ASIN:B07J2WBKXF) with adapter (ASIN: B07D7VM8GM). I have been able to successfully upgrade myself. Review is on the SSD page.

    Finally a MacBook possession. Got it in 50k in Diwali sale. Technically good laptop.Good News.luxury product, niche technology, good battery life, reliable machine (other laptops crash and become defunct in 6-10 years), no anti-virus required, security of data and transactions much better. Terrific sense of possession & pride.Bad News. Problems will be there if you are switching from windows based system - very less space in hard disk, no CD drive, inability to transfer data from Mac to your existing external hard disc unless you format it, apps are mostly paid and re unreasonably expensive (no free apps which are available otherwise on google play store, even the angry bird costs Rs 400 !!), all printers are not compatible (e.g. the most economical MFD laser printer RICOH SP 111 can't be used), huge compatibility issues with Pages (MS Word) and Keynote (powerpoint) unless you master it by working on these (still mostly the document and slides either do not open in windows environment or have distortion issues). you need to spend extra for an external CD writer and tp buy a carry bag. Mac con not be connected to most of the projectors unless you buy some connectors, which are expensive and theres no clarity which one to buy and from where. you can't connect it to your TV, the ports are different and again theres no clarity - customer support, manuals or help section are silent ! Marketing strategy for Indian market, if at all has been planned, has been very bad. If these critical issues (and a few more not mentioned here) are handled properly, the Mac can sweep away other laptops in India. Presently, it doesn't seem to be happening.Overall Verdict.If compatibility issues mentioned above do not bother you, go for it. Else, think hard.  If its an emotional issue to own a long cherished Mac, then its a different thing. Go ahead and gradually you would figure out most (but not all) of the above problems, like I did.

    Best Laptop under 60k. If you don't want any accounting softwares like tally or busy then go for it, better than windows in every term. I just love it's battery life with sleek look <U+0001F60D>Now talking about MS officeIt's available on app store, free for 1 monthAfter that you will have to pay.You cannot install pirated version but if you install Windows 7 or any other version then u can use Ms office for freeBut in MacBook there are other apps which are good substitute for Ms office appsNumbers for ExcelPages for wordKeynote for PowerPointAnd you can convert your numbers file to Excel file or csv fileSame for the pages & keynoteSo no need of Ms office for me.Cons1. U cannot play games, your laptop will just heat up, battery will drain* U cannot play pubg mobile on emulator if you are pubg lover<U+0001F601>2. Storage 128gb, it will work fine but if you want to store movies or TV shows u can't, u have to buy external hard disk

    I have been a Macbook pro user for last 2 years. I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience# Force touch - More comfortable touch pad, less finger pain compared to buttons on Air, Adjustable pressure# Retina display - More pixels, Better viewing angle. Air is 1440x900 while PRO is 2560x1600 pixels# Better performance - Pro CPU is actually about 50% faster than AIR, but in real world tests, apps launch at similar speed in both PRO and Air. The difference is notable only when you run CPU intensive tasks like Programming, Video encoding, Photo editing, Raw conversion etc. Those who are not into this can go with Air and save some money.# Newer CPU - Macbook air has not evolved much compared to PRO. The 2017 Air uses the same fifth generation CPU as the previous version (2015). But with a little upgrade in CPU speed. ie 1.6 GHz to 1.8 GHz. The newer PROs come with 7th generation Intel processors. The difference is mainly with the energy consumption.# HDMI port - You don't need display port adaptor# New keyboard - The 2016 PRO has the same keyboard as the \"Macbook\". Keys are less deeper and more wider. This makes it little more comfortable to type. Air comes with the same old keyboard as 2015 PRO# Wider touch pad - Not a big deal. But if someone loves that, its a bonus# Color options - Yes, Air is only available in Silver, PRO comes in 3 color optionsIf you think, all the above justifies the price difference between the PRO and Air, go for the PRO. The only benefit that Air offers is battery life. PRO offers 8-9 hours only, while Air offers, 11-12 hours battery.Whom Air is for?Macbook air is not a gaming machine or for hard core users. Its for people who love to watch lot of movies, work on documents, browse and some basic programming. When i say programming, Xcode works fine on Macbook air. But Software like Android studio, Photoshop seems to struggle a little on Air. But if you are once in a while user of intensive apps, you can ignore this.I will update my review with more details after a few weeks of hands on testing and usage. If you have any queries leave a comment below. I will try to answer in a day or two.Thanks for reading! Hope this helps.Also, Get 10% Cashback by Ordering through vqr .in/24

    I am very upset about the product as I checked my MacBook 15 days back in December, it didn’t start. It was luckily in warranty . I took it to the service centre and they informed me the mother board and battery collapsed. If it was not in warranty I had to pay 47000/. I asked for replacement of the product and I was refused. They got it fixed for me. I don’t know why should I pay 57000/ for Mac quality. If this is the quality and the service, then I have to go to other product. In January my product expiry was due. They have give an extension of 3 months warranty when I had asked for 1 year. Very disappointed.

    We buy macbook's expecting that it will lasts at least 3 years, not in my case they are saying it will costs 46000rs to repair.. i bought this in 58000rs.. if i don't want to repair it still I've to pay 2500rs as diagnostic cost.. not recommended..

    Reason for 1 star is I ot an defective piece. The sound quality was not good . My laptop started giving issues with power button from  4 months. The screen would flicker and it would shutdown automatically after sometime. Took the mac to service centre. They replaced the motherboard free of cost as it was in warranty. Now my mac is perfectly fine :
  
"
"







  
  
    Bought this product recently on 5 April, was working perfectly fine for few days and on 16 April the Mac working charge or turn on. Apple service centre says they can’t fix the product under warranty and amazon in try to come up with a solution ever since , no solid answer . I m stuck with a dead mac after using it for 10days. Request seller , Amazon or apple to take full responsibility.

    Hi, Think thousand time before buying. One calm night i was cuddling in jaipuri blanket while enjoying youtube on this expensive machine. Cold night and little excitement created electrostatic charge which spike though spaceBar button. that's how it went to deep sleep forever. Nothing can bring it back and i am in no mood in spending another fortune on this machine. Apple, of you (i)care, this is the least of security feature included in all electronic devices. And the best part, it was a week after Warranty expiration date.

    Got the Apple Macbook air on amazon discount sale.1) The OS is smooth and is a breeze to work with. Ships with macOS sierra but update is available to macOS mojave2) The design and build quality, as you can expect from an apple product is top notch.3) Excellen sound quality, keyboard.Cons:1) 128GB may be low incase you want to have movies and media in your laptop.You need to carry around a hard disk that kind of nullifies the advantage of having a light weight laptop.2) Display resolution is not exactly upto the mark

    I use this for music production and it works awesome..however the display is not so good as it should have been in a 63k laptop

    White line coming on screen in just three months of purchase from amazon. Doubting the quality of the products sold on amazon

    Never purchase any Apple products. I bought 3 and start giving problems just after 6 months. I need to visit 4 times service station which is far 12 km. Again MacBook start acting dead after 6 more months. Mean a top priced laptop giving problems in every 6 months.I have good experiences with other brands of laptops. I hope this comment can help to save somebody’s money.

    Good purchase of mineBest for programming...Only some heating issues...but can be ignored!!

    I bought MacBook air in 2017, it was working fine till last month. It suddenly stopped charging I took it apple care and was shocked to hear the feedback. They told me that the motherboard is dead and i have to buy a new motherboard. The cost was 50k ( i bought at 53k in 2017). We buy Apple products because they are meant to be long-lasting. I am really disappointed and would prefer other companies next time. They earn extra money from selling an extended warranty.

    I bought it last year from Amazon during Sale. It worked well for on year and then suddenly stopped working. I am unable to switch it on. I took it to service centre and they told that the logic board has to be replaced. The cost is around 45000. I am helpless. I dont want to invest more into that. I used the laptop very carefully but I think Amazon sent a defected piece on sale.

    All are Gud.. For now..
  
"
"







  
  
    Bought it on 9th July, stopped working / not turning power on by 4th Nov. Adding to this disappointment is - Apple's refusal to repair it under warranty stating that there is corrosion in Logic Board. Amazon also did not help. The seller - Appario - does not like to be bothered with it. Sometimes I wonder if buying electronics online is a good idea!
  
"
"







  
  
    It worked only for a year. A year + 1 day it stopped working and apple has the worst customer service.No solutions
  
"
"







  
  
    Bought this MacBook for 51K in 2018 and 2 weeks back my laptop stopped working without the adaptor even at 100% I went to the Apple Store and they informed me that the logic board had corrosion and it would cost me 42K to get it replaced. Just after my warranty of a year expired, this issue came up. Highly not recommended. This was a defective piece and very conveniently Amazon/Apple sold a product that would last more than a year (the warranty) time just to have customers pay almost just as much to fix the laptop. I was major fan of Apple and its products but now I am really disheartened. I hate what happened. Cannot spend a dime on any Apple product ever again. PLEASE read this review before buying the product. Amazon/Apple PLEASE SELL BETTER PRODUCTS AND DO NOT PLAY WITH CUSTOMERS AND THEIR MONEY

    Apple,apple,apple, thats the first thing that must have flashed in you mind when you saw this product, so here i have a total breif review on the laptop...***Pros***4k Video Editing with Final Cut Pro X on this thing works like butter, there is heating issue that i am going to go to apple service center to get it checkedEveryday works like checking mail and is just gr8The Battery is just OVERPOWERED, works for around 11-12 hours on continuous work and 8-9 hours when editingThe graphics card scores 30 fps in cinebench which is not that badThe performance is also fine, 280 cb processor score on cinebenchSpeakers are really good with perfect bassDisplay brightness is 300 nits, which is fineThe Wi-Fi is extremely good, can get a network even from the living room while the router is in the bedroomVery thin and lightweightMacOS is good for School work if you know all the office applications for mac, for eg.Pages is WordMagSafe 2 is the best partGood Trackpad and Keyboard with backlightThe Storage is fast!, thanks to the M.2 based SSD!***Cons***Display, though the resolution is fairly good for a 13.3 inch display, the viewing angle is not appropriate for a 84k laptopGets heated up (Going to get it checked by apple support). Cooling not appropriate for this cpu, need a better thermal paste and fanRam management on MacOS Mojave is not good, 8 GBs of memory is not well distributed among all tasks running in backgroundMacOS is not made for gaming, you need to boot camp on this mac with Windows if you are really a hard-core gamerIntel HD integrated graphics at the price???, god damn it apple (Though its not bad, have seen GeForce 940MX at the same price)No Force trackpadBezels are way too thick in today's standardsNo thunderbolt 3 or Usb CCan't detect Android Devices until Android Device Explorer is installedThe Storage is less! (128 GB, will upgrade to 256 GB in a few years)***My Verdict***This devices is for them who want Battery and Power, and people who want to do Video Editing on Final Cut Pro X, if anyone has a heat up issue than you should Call apple Support and visit one service center immediately to get your laptop checked! Though the graphics is OK from my view, apple could have given better graphics like the radeon vega 8 graphics or Intel Iris Plus or Pro for a laptop that is so expensive! Everything else is Great! And MacOS is not that hard, i easily use both my Lenovo Gaming PC and my apple macbook air easily! Go for it if you are in the criteria I explained above! For hard-core video editing I would recommend atleast an iMac 4k or MacBook Pro Base Model because of its cooling Fan structure, Better Graphics and CPU! This Air is enough to edit 4k60fps videos but will slow down a bit in 5k60fps! While exporting the 4k60fps video the CPU and GPU went up to 104 degrees, this is the reason i am going to apple support! Thank You if you read the whole review because I spent a lot of time writing this!*Update on 8 Oct, 2019*Apple service did nothing, so I thought of doing my own service! Yes, I changed the thermal paste and dusted the fan, now, everything is running even better than ever, even the heating issua is solved! Now while exporting a 4k 60 fps video, it's just around 80 degrees, hence no thermal throttling, Yay!

    There's a reason why people vouch for Mac books and I doubt it out now.... Excellent build quality, not only if the laptop but also of the accessories, the battery life is good, and sound is awesome. The look and feel of the product is just excellent. A 5 star in every aspect.

    Thanks to amazon for superb timeliness and hassle-free delivery. Original item received. Properly packed for safety and kudos to the exchange offer i got it in somewhat lesser price. Still there are a few things or two like the caps lock key is being non responsive sometimes which might not be amazon's fault but still..its amazon who is in between. Overall the product is good. I'm fully satisfied with the performance and battery life. It actually gives upto 12 hours of battery life while you do small modular works.

    The sheer fluidic response on this machine is simply awesome. Totally worth every penny.Even though I use Windows in my office for programming but this machine is a beast when it comes to performance. Zero lag, super fast reboot. Got it at a good deal for 47k.

    excellent product with good exchange price... I like product and service

    In 3 Days of Use The Laptop stopped working and not powering on.

    My experience was little bitter in a sense that for my Mac, USB port is not working. Took my newly bought Mac to Apple Service centre. they have checked and come up with comment \"USB port is not working\". However I believe they might have tried all possible option of software upgrade, iTunes upgrade etc, cable shuffle to work out but nothing works well. so Returning this machine and looking after replacing it with correct one.
  
"
"







  
  
    I bought it last year from Amazon during Sale. It  suddenly stopped working twice in span of 1.5 yrs. I am unable to switch it on. After three months of purchase, I took it to service centre and they told that the logic board has to be replaced. The cost is around 45000. Luckily it was in the warranty. Now again after a eight month of replacement, it's dead again. I am helpless. I dont want to invest more into that. I used the laptop very carefully but I think Amazon sent a defected piece on sale.

     There is nothing to dislike about this machine. I'm sold by her looks, sleek and grace. It is not user friendly specially because i've had my hands on the black laptops forever but i'm getting around. I purchased Apple MacBook last year in December and it's been a pretty awesome experience. I love the MacOS applications. The keyboard is a delight to work in the dark. I have no issues with the sound quality! As a single user machine ,she never disappoints. Battery life is as mentioned. But to be very honest , I bought this machine because it adds to my collection of awesome gadgets. And I bought it because I could, I am so grateful! I love Apple products. They make for good show off, they look unique and stand out. This machine has been one of my best investments and technology acquired. So proud of her.

    Stopped working before I could repay the EMI's. Just after the warranty expired, the laptop refused to turn on. Apple repair center asks Rs 43000 for spare part. I am throwing it in trash and never buying an apple product again.
  
"
"







  
  
    I purchased this product in February 2018 from Amazon. The power button started giving problems in end-May 2019. The computer just would not startup. I scanned the Net for such problems.  A lot of work arounds: push the Start button+ shift button etc. This worked for a few days. Then such work around too stopped working at all - the computed refused to start-up once shut down. Surprisingly, I ran the computer diagnostics on the Macbook, and the diagnostics program could not find any defect! I was surprised that even if the program could not find a defect on the computer, yet the computer once shut down would not start up.Secondly, finding a  Macbook authorised service center too is an onerous task in India. The Service center informed me that there is a problem with the mother board. And it needs to be replaced. Wow! Next time I would stick to my windows notebook, would never purchase a Macbook again!

    For a full year until the warranty was valid, this MacBook Air worked like a charm. Then it died. No response to power button. No internal mechanical movement. The laptop is just dead. I gave it for repair at an Apple authorized service center and they told me it was a failed Power Section and IC. I paid Rs. 13,300 for replacement and service charge of these parts only for the laptop to run fine for a couple of days and then die out in th same way. The dealer says I would have to pay the same amount to get the parts replaced again with no guarantees that the issue won't turn up again. Never trusting an Apple product again. For such a rich money hogging brand, they offer the shoddiest quality of service and products ever.

    Was shocked to received a defective Apple MacBook. The device was not booting. Amazon was prompt in sending service Engineer, who certified the item defective. This item was replaced with a brand new MacBook as per Amazon policy. However to my dismay, this new MacBook also had a similar defect, which was again certified by the service Engineer. Apple is the world leader in laptops, and what amazes me is the 'QC' or the lack of it.Finally I had to request Amazon to refund the amount, which they did.

    It did not run properly for even a week...it is on service centre from 20 days

    I purchased this for my mother, she is a prolific writer / poet and spends a ton of time on computers these days as a result. She has had fairly bad experiences with build quality, frequent hardware issues with other brands in the past and so wanted a good sturdy sleak laptop, this was a perfect  fit for her, especially now that the price was reasonably low and discounted, it was a no-brainer.
  
"
"







  
  
    Do not go after brand. You can get pretty good configuration in this price. My MacBook is dead after 1 year when I kept it in cupboard for 2 weeks without use. Don't know how much I have to spend now ..
  
"
"







  
  
    I wanted to purchase the product in no cost EMI as what was displayed, but due to amazon internal error I had to purchase it on one go, so bit unsatisfied with amazon. Rest the product was good.

    well I have been using a windows laptop in the premium category for quiet some time.most of my time was spent dealing with driver issues with oem manufacturers, colossal problem with heating, os stutter in a 16 gb ram machine.i decide the pros and cons and again switched back to MacBook Air .1)the trackpad works like a dream.not like horrible windows with lag and stutter.multi gesture is a dream2) admittedly the display is not hd.but trust me much better than the much touted hd displays of horrific windows laptops I have used.in the same price range3)I am not a video editor but I am sure high end editing on 4k etc will be a challenge.but routine like image editing etc will be not an issue.if vfx pro etc is your daily grime look the Mac book pro4)routine work is a breeze..like..so cool the intuitive..experience...more so if you are in to the experience of apple ecosystem..airdrop etc...is very easy to comprehend5)the built quality and the battery is simply superb.here the low res display helps in easily 10-11 hours of usage.and 2 weeks of standby6)it is lighter and slimmer even than the new MacBook Air.7)no other MacBook has the glowing apple logo if it means much to you.maybe a collectible later:-)8)daily tasks are a breeze..however high end gaming will take a hit..tip:try and go for the extended warranty...at an apple store/apple protection plan

    Writing the review after a two yr usage of macbook. Bought it because of very good experience with other apple product. But this was pathetic. Within a year of use the screen had vertical colorful lines. Luckily it was under warranty and got it mended.Exactly after another yr i faced the same issue and cost of repair is only 42k.Very disappointed and people shld be aware of this issue before purchasing.Would not recommend to anyone.

    I got this for 52K during Amazon Sale. I can say that this is the best budget friendly Macbook ever.I have been a windows user for a very long time and always wanted to try a Mac because the whole world uses it. I used to be an Apple critic. But after using it for months, I can say that I am never going back to Windows again.The only thing Windows does better is gaming. Buy a Windows if you care about gaming. For everything else, Mac should be your preference. If you are looking forward to developing iOS or Mac apps, Mac is the only way.It is much more faster, responsive and sturdy than my Windows laptop. The OS never crashes and the performance is just flawless. Meanwhile my Windows laptop crashes very often ( Blue screen of death, Unwanted updates, driver incompatibility etc). I receive free OS updates every now and then and there has never been a compatibility issue.Apple - You just earned a new customer for life. Just make sure you don’t keep increasing the prices as it is the only con I can think of.TL;DR - If you want a laptop that is not going to irritate you every now and then and your budget is 50-60K. Wait for the sale and go for this Mac. But remember - This is not for gaming. For that, buy windows

    Very disappointed by the product quality. After carefully using for 2 years my device stared giving me problem. As soon as welcome screen appears and I key in my credentials screen turns to green and lines all over it.  When I contacted Icare they charged 1990 rs as diagnosis charge and after diagnosis, they sent me mail that \"Checked and Found device is not powering on. Did SMC, PRAM and checked with known good power adapter - Still same issue, Checked internal condition - found liquid damage and corrosion marks on logic board. Hence Logic board need to replace the logic board under exchange price to check further. customer denied service .\"  and overall repair charge was 48950 rs. Which is more than the cost of the laptop (44k when I purchased it.) and battery charge 12k separately

    Apple Products are usually good, perform well and noncomplicated. I bought this laptop in Sep 2017 through Amazon. Today, just over two years the thing is dead and Apple Support says pay Rs.50,000.00 to change the motherboard. I bought it for Rs.60,000.00.  No guesses for anyone whothinks whether it is worth repairing. The propriety thing with Apple just goes a little too much. I did contactApple support asking them to reconsider their warranty terms.They said \"just too bad\" or word to that effect. I am now reconsidering buying any of their products. Just too bad.... So there you are. anyone thinking of buying apple products keep in mind the huge costs.... not to forget the likely short life of \"great Products\". O

    After using almost 6 months I am sharing my review, I suggest to not buy this at all because after purchase within 10 days it's gave me shock while charging, after many followups finally they replaced with new laptop, I am quite happy that time but again same issue after 1 month, within 6 months I went to service center 2 times, Again I need to go 3rd time, That keys not work properly after some days and battery also not great, And worst gaming experience because its provide too much heat, We can't even use 30 min, Worst experience with Apple and work experience with amazon agents No one give customer satisfaction after purchasing

    I brought this mac air on sep 2017. From past 1 week I am not able to turn on my mac, went to apple store and after troubleshooting they said it is having motherboard problem and need to replace which cost 50k, I was shocked and said how come in less than 2 year mac will have this issue. So kindly please beawre on this big bug mac air.

    Not satisfied, purchased on Mar 2018, it was working well, now getting off suddenly  , went to apple service center but they are asking 45-50k and stating that it's motherboard problem.  Who will pay this much for repair, pls guide

    Don't buy for the pride or quality advertised. The lapot keyboard failed just 2 days after the warrenty period. Service cost was 19,000. So I backed out and was using a USB keyboard. Now the whole system is not switching On. Took to local service center it has costed me 3,500 to just make it work again and still will cost more to make the keyboard replaced. Truly gutted. I have my HP laptop pro book almost 9 years old still running without any issues. Was planning to buy an IPhone but surely not after this. Deeply sad by the experience.

    Always apple is the best product.build quality and software works together.u can’t use this one for media purposes.its one time investment for office use.

    Everything was fine until one fateful day, the laptop decided not to work! When I checked with Apple service centre, they are telling logic board to be replaced and it costs 45k! Since I did not purchase any additional warranty, neither I cannot repair this nor cannot leave just like thatSurprisingly the fault happened after few months of 1year warranty with no sign of faulty behavior until that last day!If you are Apple Fan buy with additional warranty else buy some other laptop

    After using Windows Operating system for the past 10+ years, I switched to Mac. The switch was inspired by the awesome reviews I got from my friends. I must say that they were all real and that the device and the tech is so very impressive. Be it the design,  be it the processing speed, be it the battery life......all are way ahead than that of a Windows device. I am satisfied to get the marvel of a tech in my hands. It is saving my time every now and then as I am stricken with an idea to pen a couplet, short story or poem.....I simply open the lid, note the idea and then simply close it....no need of shutting the OS down everytime. Working perfectly.

    One of the worst product i have ever bought. The screen will get fade out after the end of the product warranty. You wouldn't have any option rather taking the laptop to service center. You would have to bear a huge cost for that.. around 15k to 25+k.. which means you need to buy a brand new laptop.In one word, \"Waste of Money\".
  
"
"







  
  
    Be careful while buying electronic products through Amazon.I bought this macbook for 56k on March 2018. After 1.5 years of usage, the display stopped working for no reason. The device never had any accidental drop or shock while I was using it through these years. The service center guy told me it would cost around 41k for screen replacement. Now I'm left with no option.If you are buying, I suggest you to buy it along with a protection plan or any extended warranty.

    MacBook Air is excellent. The build is super strong, the operating systems runs smooth. The trackpad and keyboard are great. The only thing that can be improved is its screen (the visuals). Not as good as expected. The hard disk is too small but if you carry an external hard disk you can solve that problem. Got it at the price of a Dell Windows laptop during Amazon sale. A great deal.

    This is the worst  apple product I have ever seen ...6 month After purchase of this fake book ...some of its keys of keyboard  stopped working ...So the service center  replace my keyboard with the new one ...But after some months with  the new replaced  keyboard some of its key again stopped working .All these things happen in one year and 3 month timeline which is roughly 1.5 years of original purchase date ... ...When I spoke to the service center they told me that the warranty is over you need to pay 12000 rs ...So I don't have any option. The cost is too high. ..So now I m working with the external keyboard which cost me merely 200 rs ... My friend bought the same macbook from the showroom and i must say its really working good and it doesnt show any fault at all .Till now .i wish i also bought this macbook from the showroom ....

    Very handy laptop, light weight and portable. Mac OS is super cool. Battery backup was good. Defective product recieved,within 2 months of use, laptop gets switched off suddenly while on battery. Requires power input to restart again.Contacted service centre, they told its motherboard problem and replaced motherboard under warranty, but problem still persisting. Laptop still at service center. Earlier i was using toshiba laptop, satellite 340,lasted 8 yrs without any problem. Paid a premium for macbook air very dissapointed with apple quality of products. And to repair it outside warranty, parts cost as much as the laptop itself<U+0001F644>

    General observation, Do not buy expensive electronics from Amazon as thy have no quality control in place/checks on their vendors. Mostly, vendors pass on defective items to customers. It is true across categories.

    I bought it with very high expectation, but its logic board got damaged in 1.5 years only. The repalcement charges for logic board is around 40500INR. I am very dissappointed with the product and I am switching back to windows.

    I have my worst nightmare with the macbook air I bought. I bought it on theOctober 2018, it got into teouble in the month april 2019. It would turn was trying to restart automatically. I then reoaired it from apple care. It again got dead and woulnt turn onn. I put all the money into water. I dont know what to do with this.

    My MacBook logic board dead with 8 months...apple replaced my logic board and fixed my laptop. But within a year the logic board is dead again and cost of repairing the same is 40k+Plz don't buy it if you cannot afford to repair the same. Not sure what to do with my MacBook Air....it cost more to repair than a decent windows laptop.I will never buy any apple product in future...the cost to repair are extremely very high..

    I was apprehensive of buying Apple product from Amazon as some reviews suggested that imported items are being sold. However what I got was fresh and genuine product, I checked warranty on Apple site with serial no. All serial no - on bill, box, inner box and in macOS itself were consistent. Display is too good and it feels like butter operating the device. Only thing is that price difference between this and 256GB version is too much.

    Don't want to mention anything for apple MAC book :)Super product
  
"

    Well the product's logic board is dead in less than 2 year. I am a regular user and only use it for routine office work. So much of apple quality.

"







  
  
    Everything about this product seems to be fine as of now. Got an option to upgrade to higher OS and install tools required for my work. Except for not so good sound quality while watching movies through itunes stores, other aspect seems to be fine. Higher storage options (256 GB) may be required for power users who may want to app development on this system. Current configuration suits light - medium heavy user(I belong to this category)- (need xcode debugging feature for my projects ).

    I was looking for an affordable long lasting light laptop and my search led me to this. I know Apple has launch a new Air but this is still a good performer and with the recent price cut this laptop makes so much sense. I was using MacBook Pro for last 8 years, and after it retired this replaced the Pro and is not doing a bad job at it at all.
  
"
"







  
  
    The MacBook is good in-terms of what it is designed for. The laptop is light weight so no hassle while carrying during travels. The backlit keyboard is a good advantage to work in low light. The performance is good, I use it for game development and I have not faced any problems until now. The transition from Windows to Mac was easy, not much of a hassle, initial few days, to understand the shortcut keys and how to operate will be little bit slow, post that it is just a breeze. Many applications are supported, no issue in bluetooth or USB connectivity or WIFI connectivity.

    Bought this during Diwali sale. Apple is amazing. I was confused between Dell/HP touchscreen laptops and Macbook. Then after going through every single detail, I must say this is very powerful machine. If you dont require so much softwares , then definitely go for it. Being a researcher and student, whatever i need is easily available through softonic or other websites. and it has good substitute of MS Office. Battery Back up is very good. I use it for 7-8 hours a day and normally it can be used for upto 15 hours.

    This is a workhorse ! Awesome 12 hours plus battery life and super intuitive laptop. Only thing I don't like is tiny memory ! 1TB would be more like it !

    Writing review after using it for 3 weeks1. Charged it twice....And it would not charge 3rd time- but surprisingly the battery lasted 10 hours and I could finish my important presentation. 10/102.The customer care told that charging port had issue  - and what a pleasant  surprise they changed whole motherboard for free Excellent customer care 10/103. Touch pad had an issue but again it surprised me-- the immediate next day it came back.. wowTheir application at customer care is so good. Don't even have to stand in que.. booking appointments is so easy... And service centre was also very good. Had plenty of comfortable seats. Drinking water facility too. Customer care right in the heart of city and it was air conditioned.Will update reviews about laptop once I get to use it...A very Good company, Go for it... :)

    I am in love with my MacBook. Its smart. It never hangs. Its fast. Sound quality is commendable. The picture quality is just fabulous. Its worth money and time. I can run any programs in it. It has sofisticated software that can compile any language programs.
  
"
"







  
  
    There is a saying in our language which tells us everything degrades over time but I did not expect this to be true for an apple laptop of less than a year. My battery life which used to be around 12 hours when I bought this thing is now down to about 6And I watch less movies now and use more apps like word or Internet now than I did back then. I don't even play games on this!!!!
  
"
"







  
  
    Couldn't have received a better laptop. Look Macs aren't for gaming.  So don't expect good gameplay. but if you really wanna get a performance, it will have it for you with a little heating.it surfs like a beast. if you do casual stuff like browsing or typing, you will be surprised. the fans rarely kick in.The battery is a bomb! Provides service all around the day with medium brightness. takes around 2-3 hrs to charge and man the safe charging system rocks. you will never tip off the mac.Editing is managed like a magical spell. no issue at all. BUT DON'T EXPECT IT TO SERVE LIKE A MACBOOK PRO, IT'S AIR.in terms of style, man it will rock you. Trust me, You won't regret.

    Defective keyboard. Manufacturing defect. Had to return.

    So after a year of using it, unfortunately the smc chip and memory synchronisation is at fault. There is no manual resetting that works and the only option is to get the chips replaced which costs around 19k. So much for long lasting. Though I must say it worked like a pro for 1 year and now its time to bury it.
  
"
"







  
  
    The product was dead in just one and half years. Apple service is great experience but they charged Rs 2600 for checking the machine and asked another fifty-five thousand rupees for replacing the battery and board which was found to have \"issues\". Now the MacBook is with my kids<U+0001F62C>

    I was a big Fan of Apple products and have been using the same for past 8 years. However the recent incident with my Mac Air that I brought through Amazon last October changes the perception towards Apple took a deep dent.Few months ago I had some issue with my MacAir screen, there was no accidental fall or mishandling on my part, which is quite evident as there are no physical damage not even a scratch which says that there was any mishandling on my part.At the time it was still under warranty period, So I took it to one of the Authorized apple store nearby, At the service centre the technician just by looking at the screen told me that it won’t be covered under warranty and I’ve to pay  Rs. 43,000/- towards replacement, which came as a shock to me as, first there was no fault of my own, and secondly the whole thing cost me Rs. 54,000/- so I don’t know how Apple justify such unfair pricing. Thereafter, shocked and helpless I follow up with Apple Support repeated calls and chatting but all in vain, but apparently I found out that there is nothing on their hand, whatever the Authorized Apple Service center says is the final. I was told it is pressure damage, which won’t be covered under warranty and will cost me as much the cost of Original Machine. I was unaware and shock to find that Organization like Apple will indulge in such fraudulent and unfair trade practice for unfair monetary gain.When I look for more information online it came to my knowledge that this is not an uncommon thing with MacAir, it so fragile that MacAir is prone to pressure damage, a designing and manufacturing flaw, and there are many users who has suffered the same, and Apple has refused to address.Currently my Mac is unusable and just like that without any fault of my own my entire saving of Rs 54,000/- gone to waste. There is no question of repairing at an unjustified cost when few thousands more will get me a new one and there are better options avalible other than Mac .Pro: Atheistic, premium feelingCons: Shocking replacement cost,  Poor Post sale Support, Fragile and prone to screen damage

    - NO lags !!- Good Battery life !!- Fit for regular office works !!- Storage is 128 GB - Up grade costs more !!- Screen Quality is mediocre !!- Apple Mac Os is smooth but updates / App installations out of home country become buggy due to apple id Error !!- Expensive

    Its said once an Apple user is always an apple user. I was using MAC Book Pro early 2012 and now i went for this one. Superb battery life and light weight. Being a corporate user I don't have requirement of gaming etc. Well, Storage could be a problem if you wish to keep bulk files. Else just go for it.  post installing MS office suite etc i am left with around 50GB, which i am comfortable with . If required I use my 1.5 TB external disk.

    After using windows laptops from almost 6 years I bought this machine. Initially it was hard to get used to the MacBook OS and it's features but trust me, after using it for a week you'll fall in love with MacBook.Pros:1. Sound Quality is really clear and good.2. Battery life is amazing, I use it daily for almost 2-4 hrs and I charge it only once in 2-3 days.3. Finger gestures are amazing.4. Speed <U+2764><U+FE0F>. No lags whatsoever.Cons:1. Apple should have updated the 2017 MacBook with Retina display, although this display is works perfectly fine.2. To use some applications, you've to buy them. Can not use cracked version unlike windows.If you're looking for a laptop (non-gaming) within 50-60k budget which you want to use it for long term, buy this one.

    The macbook received has a faulty keyboard. The keys are taking wrong input. eg: on pressing @, the macbook is receiving \" as input. It's really irritating as there is no option to return or replace the product via Amazon. Please help ASAP. Its an expensive purchase and there is no support from Amazons end.

    It's still best to buy in 2019Design is out-standingBattery life can be one of the reasons to buy because it literally give more than 10 hours(with internet use)Its weight is just 1.2 kg..i mean its sooo..lightweightI dont think anyone can complane against this product..Ya price is a bit high..But focus at the product they r giving to u..its the best laptop i would recommend in this price range..(50k-58k)+This is not for gaming so plz dont make a mistake to buy it for gamingScreen quality is quite a bit low(only if u are habitual of using 4k screen)Track pad works at it's best..the gestures they provide u..the shortcut of keypad u can never get in any other windows laptop

    Got defective product and Amazon is not ready to return/replace the laptop. It's battery is draining in 5 hours and screen quality is also too bad. Please go for other brands in cheaper price otherwise you may regret later that you could have gone for other options.

    if you're not doing any hardcore processing work like coding, video editing. MacBook Air is best for the normal everyday life use.- very good battery life- amazing OS- nice sound and video quality- processor is old but it do the work for basic tasks and doesn't heat up.If its in your budget go for it you wouldn't regret it.

    Amazing product..it has quality written all over it..great battery, easy to adapt if you are moving from windows..the trackpad, gestures, everything is so damm goodHad read many reviews about the display being bad...it is..if you are trying to look at atomic level details..its a fantastic screen with great audio output..Everything g screams quality and premium about the macbook..love it.

    Battery back up reduced after 9 months.I brought Macbook Air on 16 July 2018 @ Rs. 48500/- after cash back
  
"
"







  
  
    The rating isn't for Apple's performance. I exchanged my old MacBook Air 11' (2013) for MacBook Air 13.3' (2017): and I haven't been disappointed. They both are fantastic machines, there isn't a bit of change except the screen - it is slightly bigger and better...The rating for the seller - I would give 5 star for delivery and 4 star for packaging. However, the product came with multiple scratches. I am unable to conclude whose fault it is- Apple or the reseller (in this case - Cloudtail India Pvt Ltd).I have restored my previous backup and will observe the performance over the week. If it under performs- I will report it to the authorities. If it performs well, the scratches may have been anyone's fault but can be ignored...I shall update this review in a week's time...

    I preferred this over other good spec windows laptop, just for reason mac. 128 gb ssd was only concern as it may not be sufficient however adding external hd or flash drive will do the job for u. Overall even the screen is not full hd i did not find it much of the issue, however If u r concern about good display must for consider this as option. Additionaly over 13000 discount in last sale made this perfect deal.

    When i received, within 15 days i realised the hinges were loose. Then after less than 2 months very rare use i got a line on the display. The replacement window was only 10 days. Now i have given it for service and even apple doesn't have a replacement policy. So i have to use a repaired device inspite of buying new. Very disappointing.

    First Time Worst experience with an apple product....I bought a Mac book air...new product not getting switched on!did all troubleshooting guided by technical team from Amazon and Apple!what a quality test from Apple?!

    The price was 67000, but in offer got it for 62000.Product is awesome, you get the latest IoS update. Extremely sleek, but memory is very low around 87gb free. Very light, stable, fast, awesome sound and screen quality. Buy one memory card in case if anyone need more memory.At this price, it's worth every penny and it's apple at the end of the day.Must buy for long term use.

    The elegant work of apple can be seen in this product. The design, the user friendliness, the compactness can be easily seen in this laptop. Coming to the performance, the speed of this is remarkable, and you can get to know the power of Mac os when you have another apple product. You can get one of the best movie experiences on this . Overall I would it a 4.5/5.

    I got a great deal on this laptop, which I have been using for almost a year now. I got it not only on discount but also was able to exchange my old laptop with this! Laptop works really well, it was a good purchase!

    3 Days before I purchased this Laptop.  It is started heating after 10 mins usage (only browser).  It seems I can't raise a replacement request without apple's approval.  Worst!!!  Worst!!  Worst!!!  For this cost we can buy some other good laptop..

    I was excited, because this was my first Apple product. But unfortunately got a worse than a refurbished Mac book, as I got this product on 27th Dec 2019 and till date ( Jan 1st 2020 ) I'm unable to use because it has stuck on welcome page and tried all possible ways and watched multiple videos to get over the welcome page but since 7 days got no help from Amazon team too. Never purchase any product through online

    I did not do any heavy work on this apple MacBook air. I was doing mostly documentation. The system started having problem within the warranty period, the battery was draining fast. Also, after one year and three months, the MLB needs to be replaced which cost around INR 48700. So if you  have not bought the extended warranty it's just too bad. Overall a bad bad product.

    I was a windows user for more than a decade and buying MAC was a big change. As I was using iPhone so thought to try Mac instead of PC. I bought during a deal on amazon and it costed me around 55k. I received laptop in great condition and it’s working great. I bought it for work purposes not for gaming so storage doesn’t bother me. Please go for it.

    Purchased a Mac Book Air on 08/08/2019. It’s been 3just three months since I bought it and I am having issues with the keyboard. Took it to the authorised service center and was told that the keyboard has to be replaced. This is not the quality that I expect from any Apple product... utterly dissatisfied and disappointed with this purchase.

    She is a monster, highly-quick, smooth as butter, quick as light, light as feathers, it brings the best of me, app launch is real quick. must buy! but every good thing has a price, and she has too!, but worth every penny you spent!

    Just love this piece! I owned a MacBook Pro before... But apart from the retina screen.. i don't miss anything else.... Just an awesome day to day performer... Open the lid n its ready to go... Amazing battery life (I've stretched it beyond 10hrs without wifi)

    All good, had to learn how to use mouse pad before using it, the mouse pad can be clicked from anywhere and had to learn Mac OS, if it's too hard then I suggest to get windows OS using bootloader, and use the previous Windows key to use in here, battery life is good and light weight.
  
"
"







  
  
    It's simply dabba product from Apple, i bought this product in 2018 and after exact one year it stopped working. And one good thing from Apple , they will not provide support like voice or chat after warranty. And if you will take this to Apple service center they will charge like anything.

    Excellent Apple. I have been using windows at home since more than 10 years. Switced to mac now. By just seeing the laptop one can feel the class. Awsome features in Mac. Although requires some efforts to understand mac technology if u have been using windows before. But smooth transition so far. Only thing u need to buy ms office for mac seperately.

    This review will be helpful for developers out here.1. Speed - Good2. Memory - You can opt for external HD3. Using Xcode and Android Studio at the same time - Still works well :)Everything is great with this machine except weird screen coming up on wake up and yes MEMORY :(

    i have used this product for almost two months and now slowly i am getting to know the defects it is having. i am facing problem in updating software and even the hinge is not holding the screen properly. i have not even dropped it once but problem are appearing slowly. very disappointing that amazon is sending such a defective product...

    I have used windows laptop all my life but this one completely took me by surprise. Very sleek in design, lightweight and super fast. Installing office 365 was so easy.. Plus thanks to the Amazon sale I got it for 53.. So I am pretty happy with the product.

    A great product. Value for money. Mac laptops are the best performing laptops despite the fact that they use old hardware. Very stable, good performance, recommended for ML beginners use.Fast boot up extended battery life
  
"
"







  
  
    Very good n premium laptop by apple. Macbook air is not for gaming its for professional use only ..For programmer its a right choice. Xcode runs smoothly on macbook air. Its powerful machine..
  
"
"







  
  
    Since I'm digital marketer, I use it for all th task that I carry out every day. I don't use it for gaming and coding. The performance is good but as per the reviews, I was expecting a better battery life that's lasts for 12 hours. This one lasts for 7-8 hours. Display is not that great, not as I expected.
  
"
"







  
  
    Satisfied my need for a decent laptop for home and professional (web development) use.
  
"
"







  
  
    Gaming - I don’t play as such and hence no commentScreen quality- as compared to any window laptops, Apple is way  ahead.. no comparisonBattery life - it is low & a huge area of improvement
  
"
"







  
  
    Some people say Apple MacBook is highly priced. I would suggest them to compare the features other laptop offers.For example, consider the weight and battery life all other company has the almost equivalent price. Integration of softwares is beautiful. I bought this for my son who was a window users. He was doing some simulation-based programming. When windows laptop took to fins the simulation in 9 hours, MacBook took only 4 hours.

    Worst product.  With in two year the laptop stop working.  Ask 40thousand to repair.

    i am software developer and i am using  this as my primary laptop for projects. i am using this laptop for programming .. This is perfect laptop for students or programmers..Built quality is awesome..This laptop still worth even in 2020.

    Nice laptop. Had got it for <U+20B9>44000/- just for the laptop without exchanging any old ones. Feels a little outdated now but still ok if available for around <U+20B9>44k else go for any other laptop. Display is a let down & the bezels are really boring to look at. It's an old processor but decent for normal day to day use.

    Macbook Air is just awesome product. Worth of money spent. Its not a laptop only, but a gadget meant for genius people. There are lot of smart features, nd overall the m/c is really robust. Stev jobs's ceation is really a wonder. Thanks Amazon for making available this product at a very competitive price tag.
  
"
"







  
  
    Very good product.Thanks to Amazon for giving this opportunity of adding promotional balance to my account once I received my Laptop.
  
"

    As all know this is one of the best Macbook from Apple and high in demand. So its very productive, high in work performance and the main thing its battery backup. Charge once and use full day without any trouble.

    Display, Sound quality and battery life everything upto mark..happy to buy it..packing n delivery was good too..
  
"
"







  
  
    Guys - Product might be good, but don't go for the EMI option as its a complete cheating method to us as Amazon will tell us that \"Interest to be charged by the bank will be passed on to you as an Upfront discount\" -- This will never happen as Amazon also will put some interest though we select NO-Interest option and Bank also will put some interest when the detect the money every month -- Overall ITS A CHEATING OPTION to the customer like me :(
  
"
"







  
  
    Had two MacBook Pros before. This is my first Air. Sound quality, durability, and battery life are good, just what you would expect from a Mac. The screen is not as good as the previous models, and prolonged usage hurts the eyes a bit.
  
"
"







  
  
    Good for day to day use but not for programmers...
  
"
"







  
  
    excellent product. got it under 50000 rs in amazon great Indian festival. This laptop is not for heavy gamers. It gets heated up when u play heavy games such as pubg. It is the best laptop for office purposes and college projects. This laptop is best preferable for college students.<U+200B>

    We are so used to of a system that we don't want to change.Tried this os and I think everything is fine...rather better.Costly? Yes...but you get quality for that.I don't know about games so no comments.

    MUST HAVE LAPTOP. IT SERVES ME IN MANY THINGS. APPLE PROVIDES SOME INBUILD APPS WHICH I USE FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES AND SAVES MY TIME AND MONEY. IT BRINGS OUT YOUR SKILLS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS.
  
"
"







  
  
    I am new to Mac & has been using this since past 3 days. So far, I have a good experience with battery. I am using Mac for browsing internet & reading. Getting roughly 9-10 hrs of battery life for this kind of usage
  
"
"







  
  
    Very robust and outstanding build quality. The product is even better in physical appearance than shown in pics. Very classy, impeccable finish. This machine is amazingly smooth and all the software and applications run lighting fast. Sound quality is also very good. The touchpad is awesome and works like breeze. Amazing product.
  
"
"







  
  
    The laptop is defective, it turns off randomly and to restart it you have to plug in the charger even with 70% charge
  
"
"







  
  
    Amazing product... Off course it's apple...Using form last 8 months.... No performance related issue
  
"

    Good screen quality <U+0001F44C> but battery life is little bit goes on slowly but surely I have say go for it <U+0001F44D>

    Old version laptop. I was given refund where I requested for replacement with version shown in image and manufacturs product details.
  
"
"







  
  
    I dont know what is wrong with this product but I bought it on 26 th Oct and its not even 3 months. The battery has died. It asks for replacement. How worst can a product be?
  
"
"







  
  
    Product Dead on Arrival. Didn't work even after extensive troubleshooting. Amazon not relativity the product. Says it will take three days for someone to come and check the macbook. Policies are not at all customer froendly.
  
"
"







  
  
    I received the laptop in comparatively low price but i am facing issue of charging with this laptop and on calling amazon support they are not responding the way they should. If you are buying laptop then after delivery check it properly and then accept otherwise return.
  
"
"







  
  
    This product is really good. When it comes to Apple taking it's laptop makes a lot more sense than taking iphone because1. Battery life of mac-book is 10-12 hrs while normal HP laptop is just 3-5 hrs.2. Sound quality is amazing3. No extra installation or upgrades required like Windows4. Comparatively virus free
  
"
"







  
  
    In less than six months the charger stopped functioning . Pls do not buy Mac products on amazon . When I called amazon they said we are not authorised to fix or replace Mac products . Pls call apple to resolve it yourself .

    Great deal for an entry level apple MacBook , 10-12 hours battery backup , happy buyer with my purchase , overall best deal, I’ve used my MacBook almost 2 month And there is no problem till now.

    Amazing product ! No complaints, compatible portable laptop for every one. OS is superb. Don’t need to go beyond MacBook Air if you are looking for ultimate portable laptop. Looks wise also amazing. Very very satisfied !

    The screen became clouded after 2 months. I didn’t understand it then. Thought it was dirt. But later I found that many customers face screen issues. Though i love mac but i would advise against this one
  
"
"







  
  
    It was my first Apple's Macbook. It has very good battery backup. charge it once a day and work full day. very light weight.
  
"
"







  
  
    The SSD on My Macbook Air crashed and that too while most of the times I worked on a desk. One fine day the screen froze and the system never restarted normally. I have a folder with ? sign blinking.I cannot blame anyone because the warranty had expired, but nobody would expect the SSD on an Apple device to crash in a mere 16 months. This was my first Apple product purchase and I am sitting with the 1 year old Macbook Air with a crashed SSD. The authorized service center asks whopping INR 40k+ for SSD replacement.

    Bought it for college. Stopped working in a month. Now I’m stuck shuffling from service centres to college with all my assignments due.Terrible experience.

    Got this at a very good deal during sale on amazon for 46K. It’s Apple after all and performs extremely well!! Very lightweight and sleek design as well. Sound quality is great

    If i do any negetive comment about this beast that would be really unfair to it..its one of a kind .light, ultra durable,,works like a charm..dont want to compare it with macbook pro.both are diff purpose machine....but one thing i have to admit the display of macbook air is far superior than any other windows laptop in this 50-60k price bracket....its too thin for a notebook ..loved it...ps:battery life is mindblowing.simply classapart
  
"
"







  
  
    Just amazing. Got it on the great indian sale. Better to go for this one since the new ones doesnt support USB 3.0. and it i expensive. serves the purpose.
  
"
"







  
  
    Really it’s a good performance laptop but the drawback is the internal ssd so think wise n make a good choice with the internal storage. Apple products always rocks.

"
"







  
  
    Received a defect product .My motherboard got damaged just after a year when the warranty expired .The cost of replacing motherboard is 47,000. I got it in Diwali’s sale for 50,000.The piece was damaged . Sucks . Have to sell it for a much cheaper price now .

    I bought a MacBook air in February it is not working now it stucks at loading screen during start of os and it is just equivalent to waste . Amazon offers no help from their side
  
"
"







  
  
    I just love this device. I fed up using windows pc's and laptops as they start heating and screen hang is a routine issue. Finally, I just have my ready to go machine with me.
  
"
"







  
  
    warranty details are fine upgraded to high Sierra performing well.. not using it heavily but yes Best Buy for the price.  Will update again after usage
  
"
"







  
  
    The laptop is not starting up after 2-3 weeks.. it is very difficult to get apple support. if possible i want to return the laptop.
  
"
"







  
  
    I am very surprised that display has suddenly stopped working. This is real bad. Now I am getting a total of around 35000 Indian rupees to change the display :(. Pathetic.
  
"
"







  
  
    This is one of the best apple laptop in this range with great display, smooth keyboard and sound quality
  
"
"







  
  
    This is super machine and apple is made for development for programmers so i am really happy.Not sure about gaming.I dont use..any windows laptop doesnt stand front of it.
  
"
"







  
  
    was looking for a light laptop for multimedia use. perfect travel companion. as I was already using iOS ecosystem, was nt tough to shift from windows to apple.
  
"
"







  
  
    Good
  
"
"







  
  
    I bought this laptop on the amazon indian festival sale. I got it at a much lower price on amazon as compared to the apple store (about 20k cheaper). Everything about the laptop is good; speed, screen quality, battery life etc.It was a total worth buy. Total recommend.
  
"
"







  
  
    The product was received in well packed and I believe there was a slight upgrade in the system. The batter backup is great and it runs smoothly for a day with fully charged. Sound is pure and what should I say about its durability. It's an apple product.
  
"
"







  
  
    Product was Good, Packing was also Good, Don't worry purchase without fear
  
"
"







  
  
    Great experience. Thats all i can say

    Excellent product. Bought it after wasting 10 years with various windows laptop. Go for it without any doubt. Your whole laptop experience will change. Will never regret the money  spent.
  
"
"







  
  
    Very Low memory size, the OS takes 70% of it so you're basically left with like 30-40 GB which is very low. It also lags when running fortnite or other big games
  
"
"







  
  
    Amazing product, value for money good I use this product for my events once charged battery lasts for almost 8-9hrs with full usage of product, heavy softwares installed but works just fine without any lag...
  
"
"







  
  
    Under-60000 best laptop in the market. What a performance I loved it... battery life is too good, actually everything is good in this laptop, very lightweight.
  
"

    Its an awesome products . look and  finishing is really good, I purchased the same at 54990 at Amezo festive sale.It's worth to pay this amount for this product.Feeling happy after buying this <U+263A><U+FE0F>

    Awesome look.Performs better than any other laptops.
  
"
"







  
  
    It's been just 2 days, but I am loving the performance.
  
"
"







  
  
    The laptop is great, works real fast. Best option for professional (coding) and general use. The battery life is about 5 hours.I bought it for 57k, even though it has gone down to 45k in past. Still value for the price.
  
"
"







  
  
    Battery life is awesome, sound is pretty good, overall the laptop is good for someone who’s not into hardcore programming and stuff but the ones who want to use it for regular and light stuffs like watching movies, listening to songs, writing and so on.
  
"
"







  
  
    Not working ...struggling to type with keyboard..all the keys that need shift+key is malfunctioning.Disappointed... Technician visit scheduled for today ..still waiting ..called up technician who seems to be unaware of the schedule.

    This is my first apple laptop and I am glad I bought it. The delivery executive was also quite friendly. Really liked this particular amazon experience.
  
"
"







  
  
    It's a so so now in 2019 at this price point.Better to go with windows laptops with SSD now in this price segment.

    I use the mac for browsing, light java development , i found absolutely no complaints....very portable 13 inch screen

    Easy and fast.The battery life is awesome and the performance is good.Backlit keyboard and trackpad takes the credit.The machine is so weightless making it easy to carry.

    This MacBook Air which I ordered through Amazon India is a brand new 2017 version of MacBook Air and it came fully packed within the said timeline. Its working well and accessories are genuine. Make sure you confirm the serial number with apple support immediately and check the product details(originality) and expiry date of warranty which should be a year from when you buy this product. Happy Shopping!
  
"
"







  
  
    Does everything it was designed for. Excellent battery life and decent entry level introduction to the Mac ecosystem.
  
"
"







  
  
    Overall smooth performance. If you already have other apple devices and looking to buy a mac for basic computing needs, this is a good laptop.
  
"
"







  
  
    Even today this is the best choice at this price. If you are not a programmer or game freak. Portable, long battery life, durable, reliable.

"







  
  
    Received my Mac on 4th November.Battery is running like for 10-12 hours straight.No Heating At All.Faced 0 issues till now.In love with this MAC Air <3 . Worth it for a every single rupee I spent on it.

    MacBook is love

    If you are moving from windows you wouldn’t like it. It’s best not to compare both. You need to just go by design and performance. It’s the best
  
"
"







  
  
    Buy this if you’re looking for a portable laptop. Nothing is more portable and cooler than a MacBook Air.

    My First Macbook and I love it.. Everything is fine but just don't provide misguided information on touchId when the product doesn't have touchId..

    A must buy product. Apple has a class. Complete satisfaction. Worth a buy. And Amazon fulfills all expectations. Good laptop for routine use, presentations, and study.

    It's a good laptop overall. I miss windows. I'll go with LG Gram laptop if I buy in 2019.I bought this laptop in 2017.

    Product was good had everything worth whats mentioned on it. Works cool fast only drawback was screen quality could have been better rest all is above expectation. Would suggest it.

    Recommended for Android application and iOS application development (Emulator is running like a rocket ). Masterpice
  
"

    Amazon selling defective products and no taking returns..waste of Money and amazon is not a recommended platform for such an elite products
  
"
"







  
  
    Highly disappointed with their service, I don't think its a genuine product, it is damaged and got heated in one hour only.
  
"
"







  
  
    Having only 128 gb space out of which 100 gb is taken by mac os. So you have only 28 gb space for do your all work. Waste of money
  
"
"







  
  
    UI is simply amazing, no need to comment on battery life (14 hours). As a whole I love it!Cons:Not supportable/compatible for all Android devices.128 GB HD.Not a good choice for gamer
  
"
"







  
  
    Already using it from 2011..so the product is as expected..that too in this price is the best..

    Apple Air laptop stopped working in 2 months, not getting powered On . Not even using regularly. Bad product. Very disappointing.
  
"

    Awesome product with great value for money
  
"
"







  
  
    Build quality is awesome. Responsiveness of the laptop is quite good. Sound quality is awesome. Performance is ok. I bought MacBook for learning to create xcode.

    Love everything about it though still in the learning phase as this is my first mac.
  
"
"







  
  
    The laptop works quite good, but if you are new into mac you would face some problems i.e. software compatibility issues.if you are a programer than you might have a problem in some of the programing languages.

    Genuine product. And that's a big relief!
  
"

    It was needed for coding and working great
  
"

    Its expensive for this old model but working well. Using final cut Pro with 2k videos is not a problem
  
"
"







  
  
    Product started making sound from internal Machinery also software based issues were there.
  
"
"







  
  
    It’s a great product for all the professionals who travel and work on the go.. the battery life is amazing  and great themes.. I really love my MacBook

    Liked it's weight n Usage but not Liked it for quality.Service centres are not cooperative.
  
"
"







  
  
    Nothing matches it in any respect. Just go for it.
  
"
"







  
  
    All works fine. No issues or defects till now. Its nearly more than a month from purchase. Nice packaging. Perfectly planned delivery.

    I call it a machine which gives u feeling to learn through it rather than using it for mediocrity surfing for ex netflix insta fb etcas they say create something wonderful on mac

    Battery backup is awesome. The laptop is great for multimedia use
  
"
"







  
  
    I have purchased 1 Month before which was 1st Apple laptop but after using one month it's very bad product experience. Laptop is automatically shut down and also battery backup is very poor...
  
"
"







  
  
    The battery life is 5-6 hours if it is fully charged. The battery gets exhausted after 6 hours continuously watching movies and videos. However charging time of this laptop is good.
  
"
"







  
  
    I think I had an older version and hence upgrades was required. Upgrades went well, no complaints on that, well would have loved to see that at the first instance
  
"
"







  
  
    Excellent product. was delivered in excellent condition. You should be aware of MAC Operating system to handle it :) It's fast than compared with similar configurations from other companies.
  
"
"







  
  
    Great value for money(when I bought it). These days it is selling for much more.
  
"
"







  
  
    The wifi of the product works only in the room where the router is. My other Macbook has the wifi working all over my house. Now I have to visit an apple service centre to get this rectified.

"
"







  
  
    After using it for more than 3 months, I decided to write a review. Its an awesome product as I was expecting. Fulfilled all my needs editing, surfing, reading etc etc. A must have thing for people who need hassle free life.

"
"







  
  
    Nothing to say . Absolutely superb product.
  
"
"







  
  
    This is a refurbished product. They are sold like as of brand new one. Hence doesn't get synced with the App Store for any software updates. In other words, it is waste of money.
  
"
"







  
  
    Fantastic buy. Apple never lets you down
  
"
"







  
  
    the product was overall nice and well delivered by amazon .This was my first expensive order on amazon and I was quite afraid but it was packed too well and there wasn't any damage.
  
"
"







  
  
    A good quality product from Apple. Not used for gaming but assume it would be good as graphics are good and the computer is fast.
  
"
"







  
  
    Product is great.  But hinge(screen lid)  on my macbook air seems loose, if i pick up my MBA too quickly the lid will also flip wide open.  Otherwise it stays where it is.  Can anyone confirm this thing.

    Returned

    Very good laptop by apple at this price for light weight activities like programming, blogging. Won't recommend for heavy softwares, video editing.
  
"
"







  
  
    Don’t buy as it’s a refurbished product , within one year sent it to service center to get the motherboard replaced .
